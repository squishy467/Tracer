# Tracer

This tool can trace 4 different things such as : 
IP addresses 
Names 
Phone Numbers 
Dead Names (Dead people by name) 

how to run : 
it's pre simple idk how you wouldn't know how to run it but just incase just download the files and open the file called rbxSecTracer and run Tracer.bat

This tool is basically just DoxTracker coded in batch so people who don't know much abt this kinda stuff won't have to install python so
kinda credit to KURO-CODE for this lol, you can find his Python2 version of this Tool at https://github.com/KURO-CODE/DoxTracker 
but all of this code was written by me just used his tool for insperation / ideas kinda thing ig 

This tool is for newer people so if you know what your doing I would suggest using his tool as it is less buggy than this one cuz it was written in like an hour lol
